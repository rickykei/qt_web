    <td><p class="style9">A&nbsp;quality&nbsp;audit&nbsp;is a review in which an&nbsp;auditor&nbsp;analyzes and verifies various records  and processes relating to a company's&nbsp;quality&nbsp;program.  In general, the purpose of a&nbsp;quality&nbsp;examination  is to determine whether the company is complying with its&nbsp;quality&nbsp;program or whether it needs to make  changes to its business practices. A company may also perform a&nbsp;quality&nbsp;audit&nbsp;in order to determine whether it is  complying with certain&nbsp;quality&nbsp;standards,  like those set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  9000. Simply put, the ISO 9000 is a certification that a company is following  formal business procedures.</p>
      <p class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style9">        Usually, a&nbsp;quality&nbsp;audit&nbsp;is an&nbsp;external audit, meaning it is conducted  by an independent auditor&nbsp;or team of auditors who have expertise  in the area. A company may also elect to perform an&nbsp;internal audit&nbsp;of its&nbsp;quality control systems on a periodic basis. Members of the&nbsp;audit&nbsp;team are typically professionals who  have extensive knowledge about&nbsp;auditing  standards, procedures, and principles. In addition, auditors should have  hands-on experience with examining, evaluating, and reporting on whether each  aspect of a&nbsp;quality&nbsp;system  is deficient or satisfactory.</p>

          <td width="340" class="style22" scope="col"><p class="style23">In a typical&nbsp;quality&nbsp;audit,  the auditor first formulates a system&nbsp;audit  plan. As a general rule, this plan usually details the timeline, scope, and  location of the audit. The plan also lists out any written  documentation that will need to be reviewed as well as any interviews that will  need to be conducted. For example, an auditor usually needs to review any of  the company's written&nbsp;quality  management&nbsp;policies, procedures,  and manuals. When the plan has been prepared, the auditor submits it to the  company for approval.</p>
            <p class="style23">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style23"> Once the&nbsp;audit&nbsp;plan  has been approved, the auditor generally meets with any individuals at the  company who are responsible for the company's&nbsp;quality program. The auditor also examines any  applicable records and investigates whether the company's businesses practices  align with its written&nbsp;quality program. If data suggests that the company  is not complying with its&nbsp;quality program, the auditor will investigate and  document this information. Additionally, the auditor will note any areas in  which the company is complying.</p></td>

      <p class="style9"><span class="style9">At the end of the&nbsp;quality&nbsp;audit,  the auditor prepares a report, which details the overall findings. The report  customarily contains a summary of all of the evidence that was reviewed,  including a description of any areas in which the company is or is not  conforming to its&nbsp;quality&nbsp;program.  Usually, the report also details the auditor's overall conclusion and rating of  the company's&nbsp;quality program. In addition, most reports provide the  company with detailed recommendations for improving its&nbsp;quality&nbsp;program and operations. </span>      </p>
