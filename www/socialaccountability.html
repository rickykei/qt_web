    <td><p class="style18">Social accounting is a relatively new concept for most  companies, with increased adoption by bigger companies. Taking the UK for  example,<strong> 98</strong> of the FTSE <strong>100 </strong>companies included information on CSR activities  relating to their business on their websites in 2004, with 81 including a full  report. However, the majority of FTSE companies did little to engage  stakeholders in CSR activities via their websites.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        In short, while private CSR standards may entail broad  participation by diverse interests, they do not carry the weight or legitimacy  of inter-governmental standards in defining substantive social expectations  (for instance, the <em>UN Global Compact</em>). Further, private standards  usually fall short of creating new substantive standards, and a &quot;pick and  choose&quot; approach to interpreting governmental or intergovernmental  standards may reduce or even obscure the full scope of the latter.</p>

      <p class="style18">        At  present, Hong Kong's manufacturing sector employs, directly or indirectly,  around 10 million workers on the Chinese mainland, the bulk of which are in the  Pearl River Delta. While Hong Kong manufacturing companies may not necessarily  be dealing with MNCs or overseas buyers who explicitly demand certification of  CSR involvement as a prerequisite for business partnership, imposition of some  similar, yet basic requirements in supplier codes would be a business  obligation that Hong Kong companies have to live up to (for example, labour  requirements similar to SA8000).</p>

          <td width="409" scope="col"><span class="style18">According  to Social Accountability International (SAI), about 50 manufacturing firms on  the Chinese mainland had been certified as meeting the SA8000 standard by the  end of April 2004 (out of around 400 companies worldwide), the majority of  which were located in the Pearl River Delta. Still, this is a sign that uptake  of SA8000 certification by manufacturing firms in the Pearl River Delta is  slow, though many reasons are cited. Aside from a mix of lack of information  and ignorance, some manufacturers are concerned about the costs involved in  passing SA8000 certification, which is estimated to be more than US$27,000 for  a firm with 1,500 workers for first-time accreditation and subsequent reviews  for the next three years. More importantly, additional running costs based on  SA8000 requirements would whittle away the competitive edge of mainland-made  products, while a combination of falling prices and rising costs over the past  year has heavily squeezed profit margins.</span></td>

      <p class="style18">Nonetheless, some  Hong Kong manufacturing companies on the mainland have noted that meeting the  first eight of the nine elements of SA8000 would not present too much  difficulty, though literal interpretation and strict application of the working  hour code may be problematic during peak delivery times. On the other hand,  some manufacturing companies are reportedly taking a wait-and-see attitude  towards SA8000 certification out of fear of duplication of efforts, as some of  the supplier codes of MNCs and international sourcing companies are perceived  to be even more demanding than SA8000 requirements.</p>
      <p class="style18"><br />
        <br />
      Despite the growing adoption of CSR strategies and related business practices  among MNCs, there are also good grounds for arguing that CSR activities should  be defined with a consideration of the local context, in conjunction with local  stakeholders. Regarding standards like SA8000, researchers at the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said that it would be difficult to expect a  developing country like China to adopt high-level labour standards as those  prevailing in developed countries. As such, CASS researchers suggested that the  mainland government should be prepared to work towards formulating  &quot;localised&quot; standards, catering to Chinese conditions on one hand and  complying with international norms on the other. It is further suggested that  China should develop an early-warning system to trace the changes in  international standards, and the Certification and Accreditation Administration  of China (CNCA) should add SA8000 to its certification list and help firms on  the mainland to familiarise themselves with the standard. According to  certification experts, however, China has already formulated a set of laws,  regulations and standards concerning labour and working conditions, and strict  adherence to these local rules should be sufficient in helping manufacturers to  meet some of the SA8000 requirements.</p>

            <p><span class="style18"><br />
              <br />
          In light of the strong expectations of corporate citizens in developed  countries that their suppliers and business partners comply with required codes  of practice (together with verification of conformity, as found in some supplier  or</span><span class="style20"> factory audits</span><span class="style18">), Hong Kong manufacturing companies do not appear to have  much leeway but to comply. Otherwise, they might risk losing the trust of their  overseas buyers and thus the purchasing orders. Where SA8000 certification or  another voluntary standard is not explicitly required as a pre-condition for  business, most Hong Kong manufacturing companies are likely to keep a watchful  eye on the development of global CSR standards with a clear bearing on labour  and environmental conditions. In fact, <u>there are concerns that adamant CSR  advocates in developed countries might adopt standards like SA8000 as a lever  to curtail Chinese imports, turning a voluntary standard into a trade barrier</u>.</span></p></td>

      <p class="style18"><br />
        Over time, Hong Kong's manufacturing companies need to weigh the pros and cons  of better integrating themselves within the global certification systems  vis-a-vis the potential of long-term business benefits, as abiding by the  current requirements laid down by overseas buyers may not necessarily be  proactive enough in a global marketplace where CSR is having a stronger  resonance in corporate quarters alongside the promotional efforts by NGOs and  the CSR industry. While striving to satisfy supplier codes, Hong Kong  manufacturing companies can reasonably anticipate that international buyers  will become more, rather than less demanding for greater CSR commitment on the  part of their global suppliers -- a challenge that the latter will have to  reckon with continually in the foreseeable future.      </p>
