GMP  standard is a term that is recognized worldwide for the control and management  of manufacturing and quality control testing of foods, pharmaceutical products,  weight loss capusles and etc. These regulations, which have the force of  law, require that manufacturers, processors, and packagers of drugs, medical  devices, some food, and blood take proactive steps to ensure that their  products are safe, pure, and effective. GMP regulations require a quality  approach to manufacturing, enabling companies to minimize or eliminate  instances of contamination, mixups, and errors. This in turn, protects the  consumer from purchasing a product which is not effective or even dangerous.  Failure of firms to comply with GMP regulations can result in very serious  consequences including recall, seizure, fines, and jail time.</span></p>
      <p class="style20">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style20">        Most  countries will only accept import and sale of medicines that have been  manufactured to internationally recognized GMP. Governments seeking to promote  their countries' export of pharmaceuticals can do so by making GMP mandatory  for all pharmaceutical production and by training their inspectors in GMP  requirements. </p>

            <p class="style20">GMP regulations address  issues including recordkeeping, personnel qualifications, sanitation,  cleanliness, equipment verification, process validation, and complaint  handling. Most GMP requirements are very general and open-ended, allowing each  manufacturer to decide individually how to best implement the necessary  controls. This provides much flexibility, but also requires that the  manufacturer interpret the requirements in a manner which makes sense for each  individual business.</p>

      <p class="style20">        GMP is also sometimes  referred to as &quot;cGMP&quot;. The &quot;c&quot; stands for  &quot;current,&quot; reminding manufacturers that they must employ technologies  and systems which are up-to-date in order to comply with the regulation.  Systems and equipment used to prevent contamination, mixups, and errors, which  may have been &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; 20 years ago, may be less than  adequate by today's standards.&nbsp;</p>
