    <td><p class="style18">Occupational  health and safety (OHS) auditing is a term used to describe a wide range of  assessments that can be undertaken for a variety of different purposes. 
      An OHS  management system is a planned, documented and verifiable method of managing  OHS hazards. What makes it a system is the deliberate linking and flow of  processes that creates an intentional way of managing OHS matters.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        Audits are  conducted to determine the effectiveness of management systems and to identify  the strengths and opportunities for improvements.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">An  occupational health and safety management systems audit has a wider scope, and  although addressing hazards and risk controls, it also looks at organisational  structures, planning activities, responsibilities, implemented procedures,  review cycles and measurement and evaluation issues.
        A basic  occupational health and safety management system has some of the following  characteristics:</p>

              Compliance  auditing undertaken by inspectors is not a guarantee of a risk free workplace  as a detailed examination of every hazard is not possible during an inspectors  visit. The responsibility for ongoing effective health and safety management  systems rests with workplace management.</p>

      <p class="style18">        The  outcomes of compliance audits conducted by inspectors give results that  indicate if compliance is being achieved or if further actions are required to  meet legislative standards. 
        Employers  can undertake similar audits by reviewing the workplace operations using a risk  management model. This assessment should be undertaken by appropriately trained  internal staff or by external providers. Persons performing these reviews  should have experience in hazard identification, risk assessments and possess a  strong knowledge of current legislative requirements.</p>
