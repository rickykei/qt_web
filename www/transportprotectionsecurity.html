    <td><p class="style18">Approximately 72% of the total  land-based transport of freight in the European Union is made by road. Therefore the strategic  significance of road freight for the European economy is obvious - without it we would not prosper as a Union or  individual Member States. In parallel with this movement of goods, criminal activity has risen, especially with regards  to theft and people smuggling.</p>

It  has been highlighted through the SETPOS project that such facilities do not  exist or are limited at best. In the interest of road safety, the health and safety of professional drivers, and  compliance with rules on driving hours and break periods, there needs to be a sufficient number of safe and  adequate rest facilities in existence along the European motorway network. Current statistics show the need  for more rest facilities for professional drivers in the European Union, and in particular in Central and Eastern  Europe. </span></div></td>

      <p class="style18">        A main consideration for the  developers of potential new truck parks or those that want to modify their existing infrastructures is to understand  the transport trends across the EU and the current criminal situation. </p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        When analyzing the frequency of  incidents, the European  corridors typically have the highest level of freight theft of all the continents  in the world. Naturally, the risk of truck crime is strongly related to the actual amount of road freight transported  to a certain region, including the transit countries. Put simply, an economically strong continent  generates more demand for high value goods and is therefore more vulnerable to criminal attacks.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        Crime tends to be well organized  and planned by structured  groups with well-defined roles such as scout, driver and receiver. Such groups  often possess customized  tools to assist in the theft and are experienced in the operation of large goods  vehicles. 
        Foreign drivers are particularly  vulnerable targets since they are unfamiliar with the risks present in other countries than their own. There are  often communication  difficulties and problems with tracing a load from another country.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style20">        A recent survey by the <span class="style8">IRU3</span></p>
      <p class="style20">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">A total of  2,003 replies to a questionnaire where drivers  highlighted 476 primary attacks. From this figure, 63% of the attacks focused on the vehicle and the load and 43%  focused on the driver and their belongings. Separately, 42% of the attacks were reported to have occurred in  truck parks and a further 19% of the attacks were at motorway service stations. </p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        Currently, truck parks do exist but  many provide a false sense of security which may even result in freight crime. Theft from non-secure parking areas  results in over 8300 criminal incidents on the road with a value of 300million Euro every year. Truckpol  calculates the average loss per incident at an estimated minimum of 19,000 Euros. Worryingly, these figures  may not show the whole picture as many incidents are not recorded.</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        As previously stated, concerns  about attacks on drivers and vehicles and the current lack of secure facilities means that there is a real  commercial and social need for secure truck parks. It has been estimated that to comply with working time  directives, over 44% of journeys within the international road freight transport market require at least one rest  during the journey. The
        Question is where do drivers  currently rest and how secure is that place?</p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style18">        &quot;A load at rest is a load  at risk&quot; would appear to be a reasonable maxim for freight being  transported through the European network. Therefore to minimize this risk, it is important to ensure that when  resting, loads are protected. Secured parking areas offer extra reassurance, providing heightened  security features to help protect the driver, vehicle and load. 
        As the figures show, using secure  parking areas can significantly reduce the risk factor from crime for drivers, vehicles and loads and are the  preferred choice for responsible operators. With increasing commercial competition, shipper<span class="style19">s who want high  value cargo moved will require that their loads must be stored in secure truck parks when in transit on the  TERN.</span></p>
      <p class="style18">&nbsp;</p>
      <span class="style18">Organized criminal activity within the freight  industry is an international  problem but can be tackled at a local level through the provision of SPAs along the  strategic networks. The  increased presence of SPAs, either as new sites or within existing ones would help to  reduce crime levels,  encourage appropriate parking and could even boost the local  economy.      </span>
