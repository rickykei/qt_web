      <p class="style12">Globalization has brought a new level of complexity to every  supply chain. It is difficult and time-consuming to monitor suppliers and  plants when they are located all over the world. But if you don't have full  transparency into their processes, you may be putting the quality and  reliability of your end product or service at risk.</p>
      <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style12">        Second-party auditing enhances the strength of&nbsp;your supply  chain. A second-party audit occurs when an organization audits their suppliers,  or their own facilities, to their own proprietary requirements. By finding and  correcting problems before they affect the customer or end user, the audit  process helps the organization to avoid the risk of product recall, service  failure, or compliance issues.</p>

      <p class="style12">Compliance auditing determines whether a process or  transaction has or has not followed applicable rules. If rules are violated,  the auditor determines the cause and recommends ways to prevent future  deviations. The rules being tested can be those created by the organization for  itself through corporate by-laws, policies, plans, and procedures; can be those  imposed on the organization through external laws and regulations; or can be  those external standards that the organization has chosen to follow  (e.g.&nbsp;ISO 9000&nbsp;quality management systems, or ISO 14001 environmental  management systems). </p>

      <p class="style12">Characteristic of compliance audits, are the yes/no  aspects of the evaluation. For each process or transaction examined, the  compliance auditor must ultimately decide whether it complies with the chosen  standard or does not. Often, the ratio of non-compliant outcomes to compliant  outcomes is calculated and used as a basis to estimate an overall percentage of  &quot;non-compliance.&quot; (Such ratios, often used to extrapolate sample  results to the total population, should be verified to be sure that underlying  assumptions support their use as estimators.) The auditor typically reports  reasons for noncompliance, if found; describes implications and risks of  noncompliance; and suggests corrective action to prevent future occurrences.</p>

      <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style12">Our compliance auditors have the skills to  research issues effectively using authoritative materials, understand how to  apply the knowledge gained to the circumstances being tested, and be able to  explain to the organization what compliance means in day-today operations.  Reaching a conclusion that an outcome complies or does not comply with a  standard is not necessarily simple, especially in domains governed by complex  regulations (e.g. occupational health and safety, environmental, employment  practices, health care, insurance, federal grants and contracts, employee&nbsp;pensions&nbsp;and  benefits, federal&nbsp;tax&nbsp;etc.). </p>
      <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style12">Technical specialists, and attorneys  experienced in the particular subject matter, can assist with evaluations. But  specialized assistance does not assure clear cut answers when standards are  open to interpretation and defensible positions can be made on both sides of an  issue. In such cases regulatory assistance is available, at a nominal cost,  through mechanisms such as official agency advisory opinions or private letter  rulings. Opinion of legal counsel can also provide some comfort, but such  letters may not coincide with a governmental agency official ruling. </p>
